# 🏠 Smart Rental Property Management

### A System for Lease Tracking and Automated Rent Collection

---

## 📘 Overview

**Smart Rental Property Management** (codename: **Leaseman**) is a Laravel-based web system designed to simplify property leasing and rent collection.  
It enables **owners** to manage multiple properties, track leases, monitor rent payments, and handle maintenance requests — while **tenants** can view their lease details, pay rent online, and submit maintenance requests through a self-service portal.

This system provides a **centralized platform** for managing buildings, tenants, leases, payments, maintenance requests, and notifications — all in one intuitive dashboard.
