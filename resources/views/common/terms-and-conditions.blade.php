            The system is intended for property owners and tenants. Each user is responsible for maintaining

            All payment transactions made through the platform (e.g., GCash, bank transfer, e-wallet)
            are subject to third-party payment processor terms. The system records and tracks payment history
            but does not store sensitive financial information.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mt-8 mb-3">4. Data Privacy and Security</h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-600 mb-4">
            We value your privacy. All personal and lease-related data are securely stored and used solely
            for the purpose of managing rental activities. We implement security measures to protect your
            information from unauthorized access.

        <p class="text-neutral-600 mb-4">
            We reserve the right to suspend or terminate user accounts that violate these terms, engage in
            fraudulent activity, or misuse the platform.
